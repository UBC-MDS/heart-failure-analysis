What was addressed: Improve the project folder structure
Description of Revision: I cleaned up and improved the projectâ€™s folder structure by organizing files into dedicated folders that were earlier missing in our repo: `reports/` for generated summaries, `results/` with subfolders for tables and figures for visualizations, `scripts/` for executable workflows and `src/` for abstract functions. This streamlined structure improves clarity and project maintainability.
